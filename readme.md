# (Ford GoBike System Data)
## by (Maged Mohamed)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made
in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area  
The file taken from the classroom has only data for February, 2019.  
> After doing some research I found that `Ford GoBike` company name has changed. __[The following quoted from Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Wheels)__

> Tracing the new company name, I found the rest of the data for the whole year of 2019. __[download link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html)__  
The twelve months datasets are uploaded in the folder `\Data`


## Summary of Findings
> * Trips increase at rush hours (8 and 17 o'clock) 
> * Examining the weekday we can see that trips is reduced during the weekends but they take longer time. 
> * Trips are more in spring and summer more than the rest of the year.   
> * Bike traffic is more at day than at night. Still at 3 o'clock the average duration tends to be high.
> * Customers only represent 20% of the trip count but they tend to rider longer.
> * Around 1/3 of the system's total bikes makes less than 100 trips per year. 
> * Top start stations and top end stations are the almost the same. This means that bikes are usually looping between such stations.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focused on the relationship between trip duration and time aspects.
> I tried to clearly represent the instances where `more` trips does not mean `longer` trips.
> I indicated the above in the `user_type`, `weekday`, `hour`
